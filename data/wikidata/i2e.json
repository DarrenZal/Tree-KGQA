Crowdfunding, P2P lending, cryptocurrencies, DAOs and DeFi, liquidity and community farming, are just the first baby steps of this transformation.\n\nEconomy is moving onto a programmable medium. We want to create a more expressive language to describe our economic networks, their participants, the nature of their relations and how they change, what they value, how it is measured and exchanged. An ECONOMIC GRAMMAR which open and free to use, gives everyone equal capacities of economic expression and does not collapse into single universal value definition of a fiat money or a “master token” (e.g. BTC, ETH etc.).\n\nSocial media horizontalized our communication, but left the information and protocol layer called the economy untouched. We can’t control the economic protocols that underpin the value capture of our communication. The next generation media will redesign the default convergence of communication, finance and computation, and fuse messaging and economy in ways that are programmable from below.\n\nThese two projects, the redesign of communications and the redesign of money are actually one.

Flowcarbon is a pioneering climate technology company that brings carbon credits onto the blockchain. Its mission is to make carbon markets accessible and transparent, enabling the efficient and early flow of capital to be invested directly into projects that combat climate change. FlowCarbon is committed to driving real impact for people, biodiversity, and the planet. Phil has deep expertise in finance and market research. Phil is also currently the managing partner at Corner3 Ventures, a seed and early-stage angel investing firm. Previously he was head of strategy at Bitgreen, COO of Datavore, he has started a financial services company, and a blockchain startup. We discuss FlowCarbon, Carbon Credits, ReFi, Climate Change, and much more. We begin our conversation by discussing carbon credits. Phil explains at a high level the role of carbon credits and how it benefits the environment. We discuss how by providing an economic incentive to decarbonize, we will help push society toward renewable energy. We discuss the changing narrative around climate change and the push for ESG. Phil explains why the current carbon credit marketplace is so complex. We discuss how FlowCarbon is bringing the carbon credit market on-chain. Phil explains the benefits of putting carbon credits on a blockchain. We discuss an emerging crypto sector called “ReFi,” or Regenerative Finance. Phil explains the movement behind ReFi. We discuss the importance of providing an economic incentive to solve climate change. We pivot our conversation to discuss how Phil fell down the crypto rabbit hole and how he concluded that blockchain technology can be used to construct new economic paradigms. We transitioned our conversation to discuss why FlowCarbon decided to build on top of Celo. Phil explains how decentralizing the carbon credit market opens the market up to a new set of participants who would’ve never had access to it in the traditional system. We discuss the second-order effects of making the carbon credit market more efficient and transparent. We discuss how blockchains are investing a portion of their block rewards to help fight climate change. We also discuss the positive impact of having non-financial use cases for blockchain as a positive for regulators. Our final discussion topic centered around FlowCarbon’s future roadmap.

Trach has a polymath brain and an aptitude for deep metaphors, which draw from a range of subjects, a priori knowledge, and empiricism.\n\nAs it stands, the goal of all of this is fractal sovereignty, which is effectively a more descriptive analog to meritocracy. The alignment and harmonization of ownership, value, and merit is key to this approach.\n\nBut how do we get there?

Is there a way we can avoid these fates? Daniel says yes, via the third attractor: creating a more antifragile world that takes advantage of our exponential technologies.\n\nThis is the first in a series of episodes with Daniel, in which the CoordiNation will get to the bottom of the Metacrisis and how we may best address it.\n\nTake the green pill anon.\n\n------\nSPONSOR PILLS:\n\n🏦 CELO | DEFI FOR EVERYONE\nhttps://bankless.cc/Celo\n\n🔑 COINSHIFT | TREASURY MANAGEMENT\nhttps://bankless.cc/Coinshift\n\n⚡️ IMMUTABLE X | CRYPTO GAMING\nhttps://bankless.cc/ImmutableX\n\n⭕️ OPERA | CRYPTO BROWSER & WALLET\nhttps://bankless.cc/Opera\n\n------\nTopics Covered:\n\n0:00 Intro\n4:20 The Metacrisis\n15:43 Catastrophes and Dystopias\n22:00 The Third Attractor\n30:40 Moloch and Values\n34:46 Mapping the Metacrisis\n43:25 Incentives and Trajectories\n51:30 Forced Transparency\n58:30 A Qualitative World\n1:07:30 What Brings Hope\n1:11:30 Faith\n1:17:30 Optimism and Pessimism\n1:22:10 What’s to Come\n1:25:50 Closing\n\n------\nResources:\n\nDaniel Schmachtenberger\nhttps://civilizationemerging.com/about/\nRules for Rulers\nhttps://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs\nMeditations on Moloch\nhttps://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\nDaniel with Nate Hagens\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/daniel-schmachtenberger-bend-not-break-2-maximum-power/id1604218333?i=1000563793660\nLead Gasoline\nhttps://youtu.be/IV3dnLzthDA\n\n-----\nMusic by WABI SABI - snowflake - https://thmatc.co/?l=7786B012\n\n-----\nNot financial or tax advice.
